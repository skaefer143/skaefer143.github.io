In CMPUT 401 at the University of Alberta, I worked alongside 4 other students
to create a web application named CAST for the Faculty of Nursing. It was
developed with Django as framework, using PostgreSQL as a database.

The application is a course assignment system, where administrators can import
courses, sections, and faculty members, and be able to assign faculty members
to courses based on a preference assignment algorithm.

To view a demonstration of all features developed during the course, please
watch the video below:

I was involved in programming the spreadsheet import feature and course
assignment view, as well as communicating with clients, setting up a server
to host the application, and initializing continuous integration with Travis CI.
