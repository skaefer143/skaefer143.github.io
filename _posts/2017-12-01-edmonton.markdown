From May 2017 to December 2017, I worked as a Jr. Enterprise Application Analyst at the City of Edmonton. This internship had me working with the Knowledge and Change Management team, where I interacted with many different business areas in the City of Edmonton.

During my time there, I collaborated with a teammate to develop a Google Chrome extension for an organizational support chat system called [Jazz Chat](https://github.com/coe-google-apps-support/jazz-chrome). The Chrome extension was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It used the LiveChat service.

I also was able to write some Google Apps Script code in Google Sheets, in order to assist with team organization and ease of use.
