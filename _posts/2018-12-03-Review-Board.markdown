[Review Board](https://www.reviewboard.org/) is an open source web application, developed using Django, that
I had the privilege of working on through [UCOSP](http://ucosp.ca/about.html).

Mentors guided us through completing different projects. I was a part of the
Admin UI team, where I completed a project that dealt with replacing
default Django selector widgets with a smarter, custom made widget built
with Javascript, HTML, a Django backend, and the Javascript library selectize.js.

[Here](https://reviews.reviewboard.org/users/skaefer143/) are all the patches I've submitted towards Review Board.

This video is my final demo video and shows the final widgets in action.
