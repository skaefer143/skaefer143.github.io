[Review Board](review-board-link) is an open source web application, developed using Django, that
I had the privilege of working on through [UCOSP](ucosp-link).

Mentors guided us through completing different projects. I was a part of the
Admin UI team, where I completed a project that dealt with replacing
default Django selector widgets with a smarter, custom made widget built
with Javascript, HTML, a Django backend, and the Javascript library selectize.js.

[These](https://reviews.reviewboard.org/users/skaefer143/) are all the patches I've submitted towards Review Board.

The video up above is my final demo video, and shows the final widgets in action.
